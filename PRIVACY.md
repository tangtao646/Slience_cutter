# Privacy Policy for Silence Cutter

**Last Updated:** January 14, 2026

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application **Silence Cutter** ("Application") for desktop devices (Windows, macOS), created by **TangTao**.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

**Silence Cutter is a fast, safe, and privacy-first application.**

- **No Personal Data Collection**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, address, phone number, or email address.
- **Local Processing**: All video and audio processing is performed strictly **locally** on your device using the FFmpeg engine embedded within the application or your system. Your media files are never uploaded to any remote server or cloud service.
- **No Analytics**: We do not use third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics or Firebase) to track your usage behavior.

## 2. File Access Permissions

The Application requires access to your device's file system for the sole purpose of:
1.  Reading the video/audio files you explicitly select or drag-and-drop into the application.
2.  Writing the processed (edited) output files to the destination folder you specify.
3.  Storing temporary cache files during the editing process (which are cleaned up automatically or can be manually cleared).

This access is strictly confined to the standard operating system dialogs and sandbox requirements.

## 3. Network Access

The Application operates primarily offline. Network access is restricted to the following technical requirements:
- **CDN Resources**: Loading UI assets (such as FontAwesome icons) from public Content Delivery Networks (e.g., cdnjs.cloudflare.com).
- **Updates**: Checking GitHub Releases for available software updates (if the update verification feature is enabled).

**No user content or logs are transmitted over the network.**

## 4. Children’s Privacy

Since we do not collect any personal data, our Application is safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
